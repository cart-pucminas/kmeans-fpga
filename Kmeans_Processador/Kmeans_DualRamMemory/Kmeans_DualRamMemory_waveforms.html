<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "Kmeans_DualRamMemory.vhd" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of altsyncram megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "Kmeans_DualRamMemory.vhd". For the purpose of this simulation, the contents of the memory at the start of the sample waveforms is assumed to be ( 00000000FFFFFFF0, 00000000FFFFFFF1, 00000000FFFFFFF2, 00000000FFFFFFF3, ...). The design "Kmeans_DualRamMemory.vhd" has </P>
