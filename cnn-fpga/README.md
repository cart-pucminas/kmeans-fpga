### Convolutional Neural Network - FPGA

- Master's degree project developed by student Lucas Andrade Maciel, using the open-source tiny-dnn library as a base.
- The project is divided into two parts (database and opencl_cnn).
- Database: It includes the original network intrusion detection database used and C scripts that can convert the original database into the format used by the CNN.
- Opencl_cnn: It includes the code of the neural network used, as well as its source files and databases used for training and testing.
- The application was executed using the FPGA vLab cluster provided by Intel as infrastructure.
- The use of C/C++ and OpenCL languages in the development of the project.
